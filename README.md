**Introduction**

Briefly introduce your project, explaining what it is about and why it's valuable. Mention that this repository contains the PCB design files for the Arduino UNO board.

**Features**


Highlight the key features of your PCB design. This could include:

-> Schematics of the Arduino UNO.

-> PCB layout files.

-> Bill of Materials (BOM).

-> Any additional documentation or design notes.

**Getting Started**

Provide instructions on how users can get started with your project. Include information on prerequisites and installation steps.

**Prerequisites**

List any software or hardware prerequisites that users need to have before they can use your PCB design. For example:

-> A PCB design tool (e.g., Eagle, KiCad, Altium Designer).

-> A PCB manufacturing service (e.g., JLCPCB, OSH Park) if they want to produce physical boards.

**Installation**

Outline the steps to install or use your PCB design. For example:
